/**
 * Sometimes the server from which an audio file is streamed is aware of
 * transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the audio
 * stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be recommended by the
 * server using the <i>Recommended buffer size</i> frame. If the embedded info
 * flag is set then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the maximum size
 * described in buffer size may occur in the audio stream. In such case the tag
 * should reside between two MPEG frames, if the audio is MPEG encoded. If the
 * position of the next tag is known, offset to next tag may be used. The offset
 * is calculated from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first
 * byte of the header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are
 * generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable behaviour
 * from present software/hardware.
 *
 * For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed tags into
 * the audio stream though. If the clients connects to individual connections
 * like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin every transmission with a tag,
 * then this tag should include a recommended buffer size frame. If the client
 * is connected to a arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or multicast,
 * then the recommended buffer size frame should be included in every tag.
 *
 * The buffer size should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one RBUF
 * frame in each tag.
