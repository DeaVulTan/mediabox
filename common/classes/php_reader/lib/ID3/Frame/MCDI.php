/**
 * This frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD can be
 * identified in databases such as the CDDB. The frame consists of a binary dump
 * of the Table Of Contents, TOC, from the CD, which is a header of 4 bytes and
 * then 8 bytes/track on the CD plus 8 bytes for the lead out, making a
 * maximum of 804 bytes. The offset to the beginning of every track on the CD
 * should be described with a four bytes absolute CD-frame address per track,
 * and not with absolute time. When this frame is used the presence of a valid
 * {@link ID3_Frame_TRCK} frame is required, even if the CD's only got one
 * track. It is recommended that this frame is always added to tags originating
 * from CDs.
 *
 * There may only be one MCDI frame in each tag.
