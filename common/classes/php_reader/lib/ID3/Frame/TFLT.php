 *
 * <pre>
 * MIME   MIME type follows
 *  MPG    MPEG Audio
 *    /1     MPEG 1/2 layer I
 *    /2     MPEG 1/2 layer II
 *    /3     MPEG 1/2 layer III
 *    /2.5   MPEG 2.5
 *    /AAC   Advanced audio compression
 *  VQF    Transform-domain Weighted Interleave Vector Quantisation
 *  PCM    Pulse Code Modulated audio
 * </pre>
 *
 * but other types may be used, but not for these types though. This is used in
 * a similar way to the predefined types in the {@link ID3_Frame_TMED}
 * frame. If this frame is not present audio type is assumed to be MPG.
