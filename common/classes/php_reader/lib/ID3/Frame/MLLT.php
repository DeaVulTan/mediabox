/**
 * To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG audio file,
 * frames with time codes in different locations in the file might be useful.
 * The <i>MPEG location lookup table</i> frame includes references that the
 * software can use to calculate positions in the file.
 *
 * The MPEG frames between reference describes how much the frame counter should
 * be increased for every reference. If this value is two then the first
 * reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th frame, the
 * 3rd reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the bytes between reference
 * and milliseconds between reference points out bytes and milliseconds
 * respectively.
 *
 * Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits that describes
 * the difference between what is said in bytes between reference and the
 * reality and a certain number of bits that describes the difference between
 * what is said in milliseconds between reference and the reality.
 *
 * There may only be one MLLT frame in each tag.
