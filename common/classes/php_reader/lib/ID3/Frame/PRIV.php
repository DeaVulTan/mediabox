/**
 * The <i>Private frame</i> is used to contain information from a software
 * producer that its program uses and does not fit into the other frames. The
 * frame consists of an owner identifier string and the binary data. The owner
 * identifier is URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where
 * an email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
 * for the frame. Questions regarding the frame should be sent to the indicated
 * email address. The tag may contain more than one PRIV frame but only with
 * different contents.
