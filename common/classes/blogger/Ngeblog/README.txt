Zend GData Client Library Preview 0.2.0
October 31, 2006

Thank you for downloading the Zend GData Client Library Preview.

To use this component, extract this archive into any directory
under your http server document tree.

Run the samples to see the demonstrations of live access to
Google GData services.

If you use Google Base, you need to sign up to receive your own
unique developer key: http://code.google.com/apis/base/signup.html

Use the code in the samples application to inform your own usage
of Zend GData.

NOTE: this Preview Release package contains some components
(e.g. Zend_Http_Client) that are based on Zend Framework components,
but with some customizations specific to Google GData.  Do not use
the components of the same name in Zend Framework 0.2.0.  The Zend GData
Client Library will be integrated with the Zend Framework in the near future.
